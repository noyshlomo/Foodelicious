# FooDelicious - Recipes Web App

This Recipe Web App is a full-stack application built using the MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) stack, developed as part of QueenB’s summer project. It enables users to explore, upload, and manage their own recipes in a personalized and secure environment.

Key features of the app include secure user authentication (sign up and login), a user-specific recipe library, a content upload page, search and filtering options, and profile management, allowing users to edit or delete their profile and view only their own recipes. An intuitive home recipe display simplifies navigation and recipe browsing for a seamless user experience.

The app was developed by a team working collaboratively on Trello and using Git for version control. The project provided valuable hands-on experience in full-stack development and agile teamwork.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed on your local machine:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en) (version 20.x or higher)
- npm (version 10.x or higher)
- MongoDB - Atlas 

### Clone the Repository
To get started with this project, you need to clone the repository to your local machine. 

### Server Setup
1. Navigate to the server directory:

```bash
cd server
```

2. Install server dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

### Client Setup
1. Navigate to the client directory:

```bash
cd ../client
```

2. Install client dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

### Environment Variables

Environment variables are used to configure your application without hardcoding sensitive information into your code. For this project, you need to set up the following environment variables in a `.env` file located both in the `server` directory and `client` directory:

#### Setup Server `.env` file
The server `.env` file should contain the following environment variables:
1. **MONGO_URI**: This variable contains the connection string for your MongoDB database. It tells your server where to find the database and how to connect to it. You will get this connection string from MongoDB Atlas when you set up your database.

2. **PORT**: This variable defines the port on which your Express server will run. By default, this is set to `5000`, but you can change it to any available port number.

**How to Set Up Your `.env` Server File**

1. **Create a `.env` File**:
   - Navigate to the `server` directory:
```bash
cd server
```
   - Create a file named `.env` if it does not already exist.

2. **Add the Environment Variables**:
   - Open the `.env` file in a text editor.
   - Add the following lines, replacing placeholders with your actual values:

```env
MONGO_URI=mongodb+srv://<username>:<password>@cluster0.mongodb.net/libraryDB?retryWrites=true&w=majority
CLIENT_URL=http://localhost:3000
PORT=5000
```
   - Replace `MONGO_URI` to be your created Atlas DB connaction string
   - You can change `5000` to any port number you prefer.
   - Make sure `CLIENT_URL` is set to your client current port.

#### Setup Client .env file
The client .env file should contain the following environment variables:

1. **REACT_APP_API_URL**: This variable contains the URL of your backend API. It tells your client where to send requests to interact with the server. By default, this should be set to http://localhost:5000/api, but you should change it to match your server's actual URL if different.

**How to Set Up Your .env Client File**

1. **Create a `.env` File**:
   - Navigate to the `client` directory:
```bash
cd client
```
   - Create a file named `.env` if it does not already exist.

2. **Add the Environment Variables**:
   - Open the .env file in a text editor.
   - Add the following line, replacing the placeholder with your actual server URL:
```env
REACT_APP_API_URL=http://localhost:5000/api
```
Replace http://localhost:5000/api with the URL of your backend server if it is running on a different host or port.

## Usage

This section explains how to use the application once it’s set up and running. Follow these steps to interact with both the client and server components of the application.

### Running the Server

1. **Navigate to the Server Directory**:
   - Open a terminal and change to the `server` directory:
```bash
cd server
```

2. **Start the Server**:
   - Start the Express server in development mode:
```bash
npm run dev
```
   - By default, the server will run on `http://localhost:5000`. You can change the port by modifying the `PORT` variable in your `.env` file.

3. Verify Server Operation:
   - Open a browser or API client (like [Postman](https://www.postman.com/)) to test your API endpoints.

### Running the Client

1. **Navigate to the Client Directory**:
   - Open a new terminal window or tab and change to the `client` directory:
```bash
cd client
```

2. **Start the Client**:
   - Start the React development server:
```bash
npm start
```
   - By default, the client will be accessible at `http://localhost:3000`.

3. **View the Application**:
   - Open a web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000` to view the application. The client communicates with the backend server to fetch and display data.

### Stopping the Servers

- **Stop the Express Server**:
  - In the terminal where the server is running, press `Ctrl + C` to stop the server.

- **Stop the React Client**:
  - In the terminal where the client is running, press `Ctrl + C` to stop the client.

### Troubleshooting

- **Server Issues**:
  - Check the terminal for error messages and ensure your `.env` file is correctly configured.
  - Verify that MongoDB Atlas is running and accessible.

- **Client Issues**:
  - Ensure that the React development server is running and that you have no conflicting applications using port 3000.
  - Check the browser console for errors if the client is not displaying correctly.

By following these steps, you should be able to run and interact with both the client and server components of the application effectively. If you encounter issues, refer to the troubleshooting tips or consult the documentation for more detailed guidance.
